November 2021: changes due to unification of chemistryModel and TDACChemistryModel
- New chemistryModel class classifies all variables private which prevents access by 
  derived class (such as DLBChemistryModel). Hence, we redefine access to such variables.
  - Be careful not to declare variables twice due to inheritance. Work with referenced variables to avoid copying 
    and poor memory use.
- because TDAC capabilities are now merged to the standard chemistry model class, it was necessary to implement checks 
  for reduction and tabulation and throw error if they are active.
- src/transportModels does not exist anymore

Modifications required since the working OF-8 version:
- gas / liquid definitions  https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-dev/commit/fe89082f73c6c65320528632c1398ce938c4ebd3#diff-4869cbe262a9a1d9d85f809d95fd3d28447edbcfce29be2e5fd04cdc49216245
- Standard -> standard https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-dev/commit/07d583e9897b16212776860936424dca913c21b8#diff-f537bda90dec8bc2ad5fc20a5ff8cbf253fb6e19fa60ba16bf88ab7edb434989
- thermo.db() not defined anymore --> new standard way to access mesh object via thermo is: thermo.T().mesh().time().constant()
- "typename ChemistryModel::reactionThermo& thermo" -->  "const fluidReactionThermo& thermo", see https://github.com/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-dev/commit/a8e809080347c18b9496f353c6cd2d9c53b3e82a#diff-4147dd0445bf26f125190b5062f8422dab84eb7db9a6bb26e13f6d4790db3fef
- BasicChemistryModel --> basicChemistryModel
    - basicChemistryModel<T>::correct(); --> basicChemistryModel::correct();
